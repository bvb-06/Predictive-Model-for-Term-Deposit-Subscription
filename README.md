# Predictive-Model-for-Term-Deposit-Subscription

In the fast-paced world of banking, our challenge is to smartly handle term deposit subscriptions. The significance of this problem extends beyond immedi-ate financial gains. The effective management of term deposit subscriptions is integral to a bank's financial stability and growth. Successfully predicting and optimizing term deposit subscriptions enables the bank to allocate resources effi-ciently, enhance customer satisfaction, and maintain a robust relation-ship with clients.

Solution
The aim is to create a powerful tool - a predictive model using telemarket-ing data. The key challenge is decoding complex data patterns to accurately pre-dict and improve term deposit subscriptions for the bank. The goal is to extract useful insights to guide strategic marketing efforts. These efforts are designed to boost subscription rates and strengthen the bank's financial position in the com-petitive market.

# Outcome

This project built a predictive model for term deposit subscriptions using tel-marketing data. Techniques to handle class imbalance were applied, and XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy of 95% among models like Logistic Re-gression, Decision Trees, SVM, and Neural Networks. Feature importance anal-ysis and managing correlated features improved model efficiency without com-promising accuracy. The final XGBoost and Neural Network models maintained strong accuracy using fewer, more impactful features. Overall, this project aligns business context, data science, and machine learning to create a high-performance predictive engine, providing actionable insights for better customer acquisition and business growth via term deposit subscriptions.
